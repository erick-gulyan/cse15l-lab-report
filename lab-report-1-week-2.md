Hello and Welcome to my Week 2 Lab Report where I will teach you how to setup your programming environment and login into your .ieng6 account.

## Step 1) Installing VScode
First, we need to download VS Code from your browser. Feel free to use this link to access the website for a quick download.
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

After succesfully downloading VS Code, you should be able to open the application to the main page. You may also open up a file of code of your choice for view/edit.

## Step 2) Remotely Connecting
First, if you have a Windows computer you need to install OpenSSH at this link below:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse


Next, you would need to lookup your course-specific account for this course on this link below:
https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php

Afterwards, you will open the terminal in VS Code under the **Terminal-> New Terminal**

In the Terminal you need to type "ssh" followed by your course specific account email. Your command should look like:
`ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` with the "zz" being replaced by the characters to your specific account.

Next, the terminal should prompt you for a password, so enter your password for the course specific account.

You may be prompted by a message which says `The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? `

Type yes as a response.

Once the password is entered, your screen should look like this (Keep in mind, password will not display as you are typing).
