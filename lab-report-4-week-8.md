## Erick Gulyan, Lab 4 Week 6
---
For the Three code snippets provided, I created a set of three tests to run on both my implementation of `markdown-parse` and another member of my lab group's implementation.

When running the test on my version of MD parse, the results are below:

The photo above also shows the tests and their contents. Note snippet1/2/3 all correspond to the snippets given in the lab instructions.
## All tests are passing on my own MD Parse.

I have also included a photo showing these changes committed to my `markdown-parse` repository.
