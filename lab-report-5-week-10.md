## Comparing CommonMark Outputs in Mine and Professor's MarkdownParse

### These steps below is how I went about comparing the outputs of my `Mardown-parse` with the Professor's

1. Ran markdown parse main with the input being all of the files in `test-files` folder using `script.sh`. 
2. Stored the output of the script in `results.txt`in the command line using `bash script.sh > results.txt`
3. Used `diff` command to compare the `results.txt` files from both Professor's and My test results.
4. Added command to print file name in script so I am aware which test file had the differences in `results.txt`.
